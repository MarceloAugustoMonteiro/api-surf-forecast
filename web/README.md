This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was built **solely** to support learning during the course [API with Node.js and TypeScript](https://www.nodejs-typescript-api.com/curso-gratis/). It does NOT follow the development standards covered in the course and should not be used in production. Also note that the app was crafted by two developers and exactly ZERO designers Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\\_/Â¯. It is intentional that the app does not include a "build" task (though you can easily add one based on the [React App deployment docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)).

## How to run the project

1. In `src/config.js`

- update `API_URL` to the address and port where your backend is running, for example: 'http://localhost:3000'

2. In a terminal, inside the frontend directory (the `/web` folder), run `yarn` to install dependencies and then `yarn start` to run the project, which by default will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

All set! ðŸ¤“
